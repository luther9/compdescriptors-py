# compdescriptors

A library of tools that make it easy to favor composition over inheritance.

Avoiding inheritance can be helpful, because it makes classes more independent
from each other. A class which does not inherit has full control over its own
behavior, and changes in other classes do not force changes in that class's
interface. For more information, see [this
article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance).
